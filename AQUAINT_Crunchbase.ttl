Radio surgery is a modern technique which doesn't require surgery in order to remove  cancerous   growth or  tissues  . It involves a  three dimensional   method known as  Stereotaxic Surgery  , which is also used in conjunction with  radiation   equipment known as the  Linear Accelerator  .    With this new technology, doctors are able to removal cancerous tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio surgery, every step is controlled by computers and patients are  conscious   while they undergo treatment.    This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as Artero Venous  Malformation   (the  clotting   of veins or blood  capillaries  in the brain).So far, ninety per cent of the radio surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in hospital for three days. Additionally, there is no need for patients to shave their heads and radio surgery causes no scar, little blood loss and is not expensive.For more information contact the hospital at srisiam ksc.th.com." .

Rural   Development Minister Datuk Annuar Musa said yesterday those responsible should closely monitor the implementation of the projects and ensure that the  allocation   provided by the  ministry   benefit the hardcore  poor   participants.    He said those responsible, including district officers, must personally check on the progress of the projects being carried out.    \"We don't want to see projects as being a success on paper but on inspection, they don't show the desired results,'' he added.    According to him, it was the ministry's policy now that the  minister  , deputy minister, parliamentary secretary, director-general and other senior ministry officials had to visit the PPRT projects to see what was happening to the allocation given by the Government.    Annuar said this after visiting a  mussel   rearing project in Kuala  Lukut   today as part of his day-long visit to several PPRT projects in  Negri Sembilan  .    Present were Chembong Assemblyman Firdaus Harun and  Port Dickson   district officer Hassan Nawawi Abdul Rahman.    Annuar added that the implementing agencies should also conduct in-depth  studies  of the projects proposed to ensure their viability." .

Addressing the nation on television to mark the anniversary of the end of the 1980-88  Iran-Iraq war  , Saddam also urged Iran to normalize relations with Iraq.    Saddam did not refer to his decision Wednesday to freeze cooperation with  U.N.   arms inspectors, but he said the United States and its  allies   would be misled if they thought they could bring Iraq to its knees.    This is exactly what the  Iranian government   under the late  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini   thought it could do in the war, but it failed, Saddam said.    \"Those imposing aggression on Iraq ... and the unfair  embargo   neglect this fact today,'' Saddam said, referring to sweeping  sanctions   the United Nations imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of  Kuwait  .    \"They are making the same mistake. Their harvest will be full of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.''    The president delivered his speech in a black suit. He had decreed that Saturday be celebrated as a day of victory over Iran, and an  artillery   salute of 101 guns boomed over  Baghdad   in the early morning.

Police still had no clues to who might have put the chemical in the pot, which had been filled with water between Friday night and Monday, they added.    The 10 workers at Xyence Co., a  wood preservative   company in  Niigata  , 256 kilometers (159 miles) northwest of  Tokyo  , were hospitalized Monday after suffering  nausea   and  numbness   during their morning tea break.    The case gave Japan another shock two weeks after  curry   laced with  cyanide   and  arsenic   killed four people at a festival in southwestern Japan. It also raised fears of  copycat   attacks.    Lab tests on the tea revealed traces of  sodium azide  , a chemical used in many industrial products, including  air-bag   mechanisms, said police spokesman Masashi Toma.    The victims of the poisoning were in stable condition, but three suffered mild  liver disorders   Tuesday, said Yasuo Hirose, an official at the  Niigata City   Hospital.    The  March 1995    nerve gas   attack on Tokyo subways carried out by the  Aum Shinri Kyo  religious cult has made Japan particularly wary of poisoning incidents. The subway gassing killed 12 people.

Senior Sgt. Gary Allcock said he understood that one person had been arrested over the theft of the 1874 oil, \"Still on Top,'' by French-born artist  Jacques-Joseph (James) Tissot  , one of New Zealand's most expensive and popular European works.    He said details would be disclosed later.    The painting valued at up to U.S. dlrs 1 million was stolen Aug. 9 by a man armed with a  shotgun   in a daring robbery at the  Auckland   Art Gallery.    The man, clad in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, dark visor and gloves, burst through the main door with a sawed-off shotgun and a  crowbar  .    Museum official Kate Darrow said the man ran through the Grey Gallery waving a  firearm   and yelling \"get down,'' and \"keep back'' to staff and patrons.    She said the man appeared to know where he was going and went to the Lower Wellesley Gallery, where the painting was displayed.    The gunman grabbed the painting off the wall and dropped it on the ground. He then used the crowbar to remove the canvas from the frame and take it off the backing board.    The robber left through the main entrance and skirted behind the gallery into  Albert Park , pursued by a member of the public. He was believed to have climbed on a motorcycle and escaped via a nearby highway." .

Shoko Asahara  , the leader of the  Aum Shinri Kyo   cult, is on trial on 17 charges in the March 20, 1995  sarin attack   that killed 12 people and sickened thousands.    Other cult leaders have also been charged in the  gassing   as well as in other slayings.    Osamu Watanabe, Asahara's chief  defense   lawyer, said the trial should not be allowed to go on.    \"We must wonder why such abnormal and unfair proceedings are tolerated. The court has been negligent,'' Watanabe told the  Tokyo District Court  .    The prosecutors say Asahara, accused of masterminding the subway gassing, decided on the attack on March 18, 1995 while riding in a car with his followers.    But Watanabe pointed out that top cultist Yoshihiro Inoue, a key witness for the  prosecution , told the court that Asahara was still undecided on the timing of the attack at that time. Inoue quoted Asahara as saying that he needed to meditate about it.    Last April, the defense raised similar objections, but the prosecutors refused to change their statement. (cw)" .

Two other people, described as small-time thugs, also were arrested in connection with the Sept. 21 theft of a  Monet   and a Sisley at the Fine Arts Museum of  Nice  , according to the sources in the judicial police. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.    The art works, Claude Monet's 1897 painting \"The Cliffs of Dieppe'' and  Alfred Sisley  's 1890 work \"The Alley of the Poplars,'' were found on a sail boat anchored in the small  Riviera   port of  Saint Laurent du Var , police said.    The police sources said that curator Jean Forneris is suspected of having ordered the theft.    The paintings were stolen by two masked men who took Forneris from his home, drove him to the museum, then bound and gagged him, the caretaker and another employee and shut them in the museum library.    The museum alarm had been turned off, allegedly because the caretaker was on duty. The two men sped off in the curator's car with the paintings.    Forneris later expressed his \"shock'' at the thefts.    (eg-parf)" .

Zoo director Hubert Luecker said the complaint was filed with an administrative court in  Cologne  .

He granted temporary custody to the  National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals  .    But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and three to  Switzerland  , Trittin last week said Germany would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its zoos.

Kenneth Cates, 53, was found Wednesday morning on a horse trail in a heavily wooded area of the  Kenai National Wildlife Refuge   near his hometown of  Soldotna  .       The attack happened about six miles off a busy road. The area is about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage.       The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday.       His only visible wound was a single bite to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife Conservation.       State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed.       Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber  rifle   and two spent shell casings were found near the body, along with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal.       \"We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said.

On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials staged a four-hour drill, said Fayez Zeidan, head of the Palestinian  Civil Aviation Authority  .    About 100 Palestinian airport employees and 50  Israelis   who will share security duties played the roles of passengers and airport personnel. For lack of a plane, the \"passengers'' arrived by bus.    Zeidan said the exercise covered arrival and departure procedures, including  passport   checks as well as  customs  and luggage inspection.    He said the airport was ready for operation. \"We just need to hear from the Israelis,'' Zeidan said." .

Prosecutor Jan D'Oliveira said he currently has insufficient evidence to prosecute Botha, but that information collected by the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)  , which investigated apartheid-era abuses, still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be brought.    Last month, the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing of the  African National Congress  ' London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a  Johannesburg   building housing an anti-apartheid group.    When Botha was head of state in the 1980s, thousands of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed.    The commission can grant  amnesty   to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. Botha has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty.    Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of  contempt of court   for refusing to testify before the commission. He was handed a suspended one-year jail sentence and a 10,000  rand  (dlrs 5,700) fine. He has appealed the decision.    (sapa-aos)" .

The  Space Telescope Science Institute   announced today that the  Hubble Space Telescope   on April 27 spotted an immense  Martian   storm cloud, made up of water  ice  , that was 1,100 miles long and 900 wide.       Bands of clouds spiraled in a counterclockwise motion around a 200-mile wide eye in the center of the storm, taking on a shape that resembled  hurricanes   on  Earth  , astronomers said.       The storm occurred during the summer in Mars' northern hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming  evaporated   the  carbon dioxide    ice sheet   that caps the  Martian north pole   during part of the year.       Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the  Viking Orbiter   spacecraft.       Astronomers used a  wide field planetary camera   on Hubble to photograph Mars during the planet's closest approach to Earth in nearly eight years.       Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up.       Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm, and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived  phenomenon ." .

In 1990, the year after  communism   collapsed, there were 702 registered cases in Hungary, and the total value of the stolen treasures was 71 million  forints   (dlrs 340,000 in present terms).

Hungary is largely a transit country for stolen art, with the line of traffic moving from east to west.

South African Broadcasting Corp.   radio said it had been leaked a \"preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid.    An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance \"informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations.''    Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment.    The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  commissioners   earlier this month.

Cohen said the United States has five defense systems under research and development and \"we hope we hope we can share that technology with  Bahrain   and other Gulf countries.''    He was speaking to reporters before leaving for  Qatar  , his second stop in a six-nation Gulf tour, which includes the  United Arab Emirates  ,  Oman  , Kuwait and  Saudi Arabia  .    \"Because of the proliferation of missile technology globally but especially in the Gulf region, we believe it's important'' to look at ways to cooperate with U.S. allies, said Cohen.    \"I think it becomes imperative that countries cooperate and develop a theater missile protection system for their people and for their forces,'' said Cohen, citing threats from Iran and Iraq.    The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently tested a long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region.    Cohen said Iraq, under  U.N.    sanctions , continues efforts to acquire missile technology that has a longer than permissible range." .

    nif:isString "   Norwegian company moves ahead with clean power plant   The  Norsk Hydro ASA   concern announced plans Friday to build a  hydrogen  -burning  power plant   that it says will produce  electricity   with virtually no climate-damaging  emissions  .    The 51-percent  state-owned company   notified the  Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate   of plans to build the plant, to be called HydroKraft, pending approval by government agencies.    The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999, construction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and production startup would occur in early 2003.    Earlier this year, the company announced a new technology that would allow it to use clean-burning hydrogen to generate electricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from  natural gas  .    Norsk Hydro, a major  petroleum   producer, now says studies have shown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the plant's  carbon dioxide   emissions would be 90 percent lower than plants using natural gas.     Norway   is the world's second-largest oil exporter, and also produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields. Virtually all of the country's electricity now comes from  hydroelectric plants  .    Under the company's plans, natural gas, air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen,  nitrogen   and carbon dioxide.    Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey, an island about 500 kilometers (300 miles) west of  Oslo ." .

Sotheby  's, the  New York    auction house  , said Tuesday that it will spend $25 million to launch sothebys.com, an Internet site where the public will be able to bid on  antiques  , art, jewelry,  sports memorabilia   and other  collectibles  .       The value of items on the virtual auction block initially will be capped at about $10,000. More expensive items will be posted when imaging technology improves enough to give clear views of items from multiple angles.       \"There's no point in having a fuzzy image on a $100,000 item,'' said Susan Solomon, head of the new venture.       Sotheby's first major  online auction  , planned for July, will feature  baseball   memorabilia.       While online auction sites have become extremely popular, consumer groups say the sites have produced more consumer complaints than any other Internet category because of shoddy merchandise and other fraud.       Sotheby's said it would only sell merchandise from the auction house itself or reputable art dealers. And bids will only be accepted from customers who have registered their  charge card   numbers in advance.       Officials at  Christie 's, another leading New York auction house, said they were also considering an online auction site." .

The Mail on Sunday   reported May 24 in an \"exclusive'' that began on the front page and continued on page three that Miss Shields' luggage was searched and her flight at the  Nice Airport   delayed while  French police   quizzed her.    After the actress filed suit against  Associated Newspapers Ltd  ., the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the paper's editor and two Mail journalists, the Mail on Sunday published a front-page apology and  retraction   on May 31.

The newspaper's front-page article \"must therefore have been especially hurtful to her and to her family,'' the attorney said.

The goal is to make it easier to travel by train to Lufthansa's  main hub   in  Frankfurt  , instead of flying there. Starting in 2001, Lufthansa boss Juergen Weber hopes to eliminate such short hops _ between Frankfurt and  Cologne  , for example _ thus freeing up takeoff and  landing slots   for more lucrative international flights.    As part of the Lufthansa- Deutsche Bahn   deal, passengers could check their luggage through at the train station for the Lufthansa flight they will catch at Frankfurt.    The service is already in place at Saarbruecken, although travelers must drop their bags off the day before. Starting in September, the service will be extended to five other cities: Duesseldorf, Cologne,  Bonn  ,  Wuerzburg   and Nuremberg.    Passengers flying on Lufthansa partners  United   and  SAS  would also be able to use the service, he said.    The airline and railway said they'd form a working group to resolve such problems as security checks on the luggage and making sure the bags get to the airport from the train station on time.    Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig said his railway also would work to coordinate schedules better with Lufthansa flights to make connections easier, and allow for combined train and plane tickets.
